# Scrabble Library for Dart

## Introduction

**Scrabble** provides an API and command line tool for finding and scoring
legal Scrabble words defined in the SOWPODS dictionary (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Scrabble_Words).

-   The API includes methods to:
    -   **lookup** legal words, perhaps includng the wildcard '?'.
    -   get all legal **anagram**s of a string, perhaps including the wildcard '?'.
    -   get the **score** for a word.
-   The command line tool provides access to the API from the command line.

## Installing Scrabble

1. Depend on it

    Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

    ```
    dependencies:
      scrabble: ^0.1.0
    ```

2. Install it

    You can install packages from the command line:

    ```bash
    $ dart pub get
    ```

3. Import it

    Now in your Dart code, you can use:

    ```dart
    import 'package:scrabble/scrabble.dart';
    ```

4. Install Command Line tool

    Activate the command:

    ```bash
    $ dart pub global activate scrabble
    ```

    If this doesnâ€™t work, you might need to [set up your path](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#running-a-script-from-your-path).

## Examples

### Command Line Example

The command line tool has many options as described in the help text, run:

```bash
$ dart run scrabble --help
...
```

This example does a lookup for three letter words including 'a', 'b' and the wildcard '?'.

```bash
$ dart run scrabble lookup --expand ab?
Lookup ab? {aba, abb, abo, abs, aby}
Score aba = 5
Score abb = 7
Score abo = 5
Score abs = 5
Score aby = 8
```

### Dart Example

See `example/example.dart`

```dart
import 'package:scrabble/scrabble.dart';

void main(List<String> args) {
  final scrabble = Scrabble();
  // Lookup arguments
  for (var word in args) {
    var matches = scrabble.lookup(word, expand: true);
    printMatches(scrabble, 'Lookup', word, matches);
  }
  // Get anagrams of arguments
  for (var word in args) {
    var matches = scrabble.anagram(word, expand: true, sort: true);
    printMatches(scrabble, 'Anagram', word, matches);
  }
}

// Print matches with scores
void printMatches(
    Scrabble scrabble, String command, String word, Set<String> matches) {
  print('$command $word $matches');
  for (var match in matches) {
    print('Score $match = ${scrabble.score(match)}');
  }
}
```

Run the example with one or more sets of letters:

```bash
$ cd example
$ dart run example.dart abc
Lookup abc {}
Anagram abc {ab, ba, bac, cab}
Score ab = 4
Score ba = 4
Score bac = 7
Score cab = 7
$
```

### Web Example

See `example/web/web.dart`.

This is a version of the Scrabble example at https://dart.dev/tutorials/web/low-level-html/add-elements#moving-elements,
modified to use the Scrabble package.

Run the example as follows:

```bash
$ cd example
$ webdev serve web

```

Then open the page `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Package Development

This documentation is not needed to use the package, just for its development.

The package converts the cleartext dictionary file (lib/sowpods.txt) into a
compressed string buffer at package development time, using the Dart
**build_runner** package and the command:

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

This approach was adopted to provide web client-side access to the dictionary.
